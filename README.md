# 🧩 Short Information: What is Autism?
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges with social communication, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests.
ASD can vary widely in severity and symptoms — hence the term "spectrum."
Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial to improving the quality of life for individuals with autism.
Machine learning models like the one developed in this project aim to support early detection, but they are not substitutes for professional clinical diagnosis.

# 🧠 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Prediction
# 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning techniques based on a range of behavioral, demographic, and health-related features.
Early detection of autism is critical to providing timely interventions, and this project aims to demonstrate how data-driven models can assist in initial screening.

# 🚀 Project Workflow
**Data Collection:** Loading the ASD screening dataset.

**Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Understanding key patterns and correlations related to autism symptoms and demographic factors.

**Feature Selection:** Identifying important features contributing to ASD prediction.

**Model Building:**
Training and evaluating machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

**Model Evaluation:**
Measuring performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
**Python**

**Pandas**

**NumPy**

**Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)**

**Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Models)**

# 📊 Key Outcomes
Built predictive models capable of detecting potential ASD tendencies with high accuracy.

Highlighted significant features influencing autism predictions (e.g., age, social behavior, repetitive patterns).

Raised awareness about how machine learning can support early ASD diagnosis.

# ✨ Future Improvements
Incorporate deep learning models for better predictive performance.

Explore larger and more diverse datasets for broader generalization.

Develop a simple web app for user-friendly ASD screening.
